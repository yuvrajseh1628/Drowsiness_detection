A Drowsiness Detection System is an advanced safety solution designed to monitor a driverâ€™s alertness and prevent accidents caused by fatigue or drowsiness. It utilizes technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and image processing to track facial features and eye movements in real time.
The system typically detects signs of fatigue by analyzing parameters like eye closure, blinking frequency, head position, and yawning patterns. Cameras and sensors are used to capture facial data, which is then processed to determine whether the driver is showing symptoms of drowsiness.Upon detecting signs of fatigue, the system issues visual, auditory, or haptic alerts (such as alarms or seat vibrations) to prompt the driver to stay awake or take a break.
This technology is especially valuable in enhancing road safety, reducing accidents, and promoting safer driving practices, particularly for long-distance drivers, truck operators, and fleet management systems.
